Using selenium to compile address lists for certain neighborhoods from public tax information. Currently, the code is only able to scrape addresses on the first page of the results. 

I tried to have selenium pull the total number of pages from the results but it only wants to interact with elements and apparently the number of pages is a text object. I also tried having selenium click
to the next page until it can't anymore but for some reason that doesn't work either. More research needed.
